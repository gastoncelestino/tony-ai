# Tony AI — Materialized prompt: sdd-init



### Sub-Agent Context Protocol

Sub-agents get a fresh context with NO memory. The orchestrator controls context access.

#### Non-SDD Tasks (general delegation)

- Read context: orchestrator searches tonymem (`mem_search`) for relevant prior context and passes it in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agent does NOT search tonymem itself.
- Write context: sub-agent MUST save significant discoveries, decisions, or bug fixes to tonymem via `mem_save` before returning.
- Always add to the sub-agent prompt: "If you make important discoveries, decisions, or fix bugs, save them to tonymem via mem_save with project: '{project}'."

#### SDD Phases

Each phase has explicit read/write rules:

| Phase         | Reads                                                   | Writes           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `sdd-explore` | nothing                                                 | `explore`        |
| `sdd-propose` | exploration (optional)                                  | `proposal`       |
| `sdd-spec`    | proposal (required)                                     | `spec`           |
| `sdd-design`  | proposal (required)                                     | `design`         |
| `sdd-tasks`   | spec + design (required)                                | `tasks`          |
| `sdd-apply`   | tasks + spec + design + `apply-progress` (if it exists) | `apply-progress` |
| `sdd-verify`  | spec + tasks + `apply-progress`                         | `verify-report`  |
| `sdd-archive` | all artifacts                                           | `archive-report` |

For phases with required dependencies, sub-agents read directly from the backend - orchestrator passes artifact references (topic keys or file paths), NOT the content itself.

#### Strict TDD Forwarding (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` or `sdd-verify`, the orchestrator MUST:

1. Search for testing capabilities: `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`
2. If the result contains `strict_tdd: true`, add: "STRICT TDD MODE IS ACTIVE. Test runner: {test_command}. You MUST follow strict-tdd.md. Do NOT fall back to Standard Mode."
3. If the search fails or `strict_tdd` is not found, do NOT add the TDD instruction

#### Apply-Progress Continuity (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` for a continuation batch:

1. Search for existing apply-progress: `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress", project: "{project}")`
2. If found, add: "PREVIOUS APPLY-PROGRESS EXISTS at topic_key 'sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress'. You MUST read it first via mem_search + mem_get_observation, merge your new progress with the existing progress, and save the combined result. Do NOT overwrite - MERGE."
3. If not found, no extra instruction is needed

#### tonymem Topic Key Format

| Artifact        | Topic Key                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Project context | `sdd-init/{project}`               |
| Exploration     | `sdd/{change-name}/explore`        |
| Proposal        | `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`       |
| Spec            | `sdd/{change-name}/spec`           |
| Design          | `sdd/{change-name}/design`         |
| Tasks           | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks`          |
| Apply progress  | `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress` |
| Verify report   | `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report`  |
| Archive report  | `sdd/{change-name}/archive-report` |

### SDD Session Preflight (HARD GATE)

Before executing ANY SDD command or natural-language SDD request, ensure this session has an explicit `SDD Session Preflight` decision block.

This applies to `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, `/sdd-continue`, `/sdd-explore`, `/sdd-status`, `/sdd-apply`, `/sdd-verify`, `/sdd-archive`, and natural-language equivalents such as "use SDD to add dark mode" / "do it with SDD".

Required preflight choices:

1. **Execution mode**: `interactive` or `auto`.
2. **Artifact store**: `openspec`, `tonymem`, or `both` when tonymem is callable. If tonymem is unavailable, offer only file/inline-safe choices.
3. **Chained PR strategy**: `auto-forecast`, `ask-always`, `single-pr-default`, or `force-chained`.
4. **Review budget**: maximum changed lines before stopping for reviewer-burden approval.

User-facing preflight question format:

Use the `question` tool for SDD Session Preflight. Do NOT render the full preflight menu as plain chat text.

Ask all four preflight groups in one single `question` tool call so OpenCode can render the groups as tabs. Do NOT run this as a sequential wizard. Do NOT issue four separate `question` tool calls.

The single `question` tool call must contain these four localized groups in this order:

1. Pace: Interactive, Automatic.
2. Artifacts: OpenSpec, tonymem, Both.
3. PRs: Ask me, Single PR, Chained, Auto.
4. Review: 400 lines, 800 lines, Other.

Match the user's current language and active persona for question labels and descriptions. Treat the preflight UI as direct orchestrator conversation, not as a generated technical artifact. Technical artifacts still default to English, but this UI follows the user's conversation language/persona. Do NOT mix languages inside one grouped question.

Do NOT show option codes in the interactive UI. Do NOT show canonical values or other internal values in the interactive UI labels or descriptions.

After the single grouped `question` tool call returns, map the selected human labels to canonical values internally. Do not reveal the canonical values in the UI.

If Other is selected for review budget, ask one follow-up question for the numeric budget.

Only after all four preflight choices are collected, summarize them as the `SDD Session Preflight` decision block and continue with the SDD init guard/requested phase.

Map answers to canonical values:

- Pace: Interactive -> `interactive`; Automatic -> `auto`.
- Artifacts: OpenSpec -> `openspec`; tonymem -> `tonymem`; Both -> `both`.
- PRs: Ask me -> `ask-always`; Single PR -> `single-pr-default`; Chained -> `force-chained`; Auto -> `auto-forecast`.
- Review: 400 lines -> `review_budget_lines: 400`; 800 lines -> `review_budget_lines: 800`; Other -> ask one follow-up for the number.

Hard gate rules:

- `openspec/config.yaml`, existing SDD artifacts, previous `sdd-init` results, or installed SDD assets do NOT satisfy session preflight.
- If the session has no preflight block, ask the single grouped `question` tool preflight above. Do not run init, delegate phases, edit files, or apply tasks until all four choices are collected.
- Cache the choices for this session and include them in later phase prompts.
- If the user explicitly provided all four choices in the current conversation, summarize them as the session preflight block and continue.

### Artifact Store Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which artifact store they want for this change:

- **`tonymem`**: Fast, no files created. Artifacts live in tonymem only.
- **`openspec`**: File-based. Creates `openspec/` with a shareable artifact trail.
- **`both` / `hybrid`**: Both - files for team sharing + tonymem for cross-session recovery.

If the user doesn't specify, detect: if tonymem is available -> default to `tonymem`. Otherwise -> `none`.

Cache the artifact store choice for the session. Pass it as `artifact_store.mode` to every sub-agent launch.

## Skills to load before work



# SDD Phase — Common Protocol

Boilerplate identical across all SDD phase skills. Sub-agents MUST load this alongside their phase-specific SKILL.md.

Executor boundary: every SDD phase agent is an EXECUTOR, not an orchestrator. Do the phase work yourself. Do NOT launch sub-agents, do NOT call `delegate`/`task`, and do NOT bounce work back unless the phase skill explicitly says to stop and report a blocker.

## A. Skill Loading

1. Check if the orchestrator injected a `## Skills to load before work` block in your launch prompt. If yes, read those exact `SKILL.md` files before task-specific work.
2. If no skills block was provided, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions. If present, load those exact skill files.
3. If neither was provided, search for the skill registry as a fallback:
   a. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` — if found, `mem_get_observation(id)` for full content
   b. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root if it exists
   c. From the registry's skills index, match triggers to your task and read the exact listed `SKILL.md` paths.
4. If no registry exists, proceed with your phase skill only.

NOTE: the preferred path is (1) — exact skill paths selected by the orchestrator. Paths (2) and (3) are fallbacks. Searching the registry is SKILL LOADING, not delegation. If `## Skills to load before work` is present, IGNORE redundant `SKILL: Load` instructions.

## B. Artifact Retrieval (tonymem Mode)

**CRITICAL**: `mem_search` returns 300-char PREVIEWS, not full content. You MUST call `mem_get_observation(id)` for EVERY artifact. **Skipping this produces wrong output.**

**Run all searches in parallel** — do NOT search sequentially.

```
mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}", project: "{project}") → save ID
```

Then **run all retrievals in parallel**:

```
mem_get_observation(id: {saved_id}) → full content (REQUIRED)
```

Do NOT use search previews as source material.

## C. Artifact Persistence

Every phase that produces an artifact MUST persist it. Skipping this BREAKS the pipeline — downstream phases will not find your output.

### tonymem mode

```
mem_save(
  title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  type: "architecture",
  project: "{project}",
  capture_prompt: false,
  content: "{your full artifact markdown}"
)
```

`topic_key` enables upserts — saving again updates, not duplicates.
`capture_prompt: false` is mandatory for SDD artifacts because they are automated pipeline outputs, not human/proactive memory saves. Set it when the tonymem tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

### OpenSpec mode

File was already written during the phase's main step. No additional action needed.

### Hybrid mode

Do BOTH: write the file to the filesystem AND call `mem_save` as above.

### None mode

Return result inline only. Do not write any files or call `mem_save`.

## D. Return Envelope

> **CRITICAL — Response ordering**: Your FINAL output MUST be text (the return envelope), NOT a tool call. If you need to save to tonymem (`mem_save`), do it BEFORE your final text response. Do NOT call `mem_session_summary` — that's for top-level agents only. **Why**: When a sub-agent's last action is a tool call, the parent agent receives only the tool result — your text response (the actual analysis) is lost.

Every phase MUST return a structured envelope to the orchestrator:

- `status`: `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`
- `executive_summary`: 1-3 sentence summary of what was done
- `detailed_report`: (optional) full phase output, or omit if already inline
- `artifacts`: list of artifact keys/paths written
- `next_recommended`: the next SDD phase to run, or "none"
- `risks`: risks discovered, or "None"
- `skill_resolution`: how skills were loaded — `paths-injected` (received exact skill paths from orchestrator), `fallback-registry` (self-loaded paths from registry), `fallback-path` (loaded via SKILL: Load path), or `none` (no skills loaded)

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: tonymem `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
**Skill Resolution**: paths-injected — 3 skills (react-19, typescript, tailwind-4)
(other values: `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none — no registry found`)
```

## E. Review Workload Guard

SDD must protect reviewer cognitive load, not only generate tasks.

- The default PR review budget is **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`).
- Count authored text additions plus deletions only for this threshold. Generated goldens are excluded from authored risk count but remain included in complete snapshot identity and receipt validation.
- The orchestrator MUST cache a delivery strategy at session start: `ask-on-risk` (default), `auto-chain`, `single-pr`, or `exception-ok`.
- The orchestrator MUST pass `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and the resolved decision to `sdd-apply`.
- `sdd-tasks` MUST forecast whether the planned work may exceed that budget.
- The forecast MUST include exact plain-text guard lines: `Decision needed before apply: Yes|No`, `Chained PRs recommended: Yes|No`, and `400-line budget risk: Low|Medium|High`.
- If the forecast is high, `sdd-tasks` MUST recommend chained or stacked PRs using deliverable work units.
- `sdd-apply` MUST NOT start oversized work unless the delivery strategy resolves to chained/stacked PR slices or explicitly accepted `size:exception`.
- Each chained PR slice must have a clear start, clear finish, autonomous scope, verification, and reasonable rollback.
- In a Feature Branch Chain, PR #1 targets the feature/tracker branch and later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch; if GitHub shows previous slices in a child diff, retarget/rebase until the diff is clean.

This guard exists to reduce reviewer burnout and keep implementation delivery safe. Do not treat it as optional process noise.

# TonyMem Artifact Convention (shared across all SDD skills)

## Storage Model

TonyMem persists SDD artifacts as observations in a shared SQLite database
(`memory.db`). Each artifact is one row in the `observations` table, keyed by
`(project, topic_key)` with upsert semantics: saving the same `topic_key` again
updates the existing row instead of creating a duplicate.

## Topic Key Format

Every SDD artifact uses a deterministic topic key so phases can find each
other's output without guessing:

```
sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}
```

| Artifact | Topic Key |
|----------|-----------|
| Project context | `sdd-init/{project}` |
| Exploration | `sdd/{change-name}/explore` |
| Proposal | `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` |
| Spec | `sdd/{change-name}/spec` |
| Design | `sdd/{change-name}/design` |
| Tasks | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` |
| Apply progress | `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress` |
| Verify report | `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report` |
| Archive report | `sdd/{change-name}/archive-report` |

## mem_save Contract

When persisting an artifact to tonymem, use:

```
mem_save(
  title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  type: "architecture",
  project: "{project}",
  capture_prompt: false,
  content: "{full artifact markdown}"
)
```

Rules:
- `capture_prompt: false` is mandatory for automated SDD artifacts. They are
  pipeline outputs, not human/proactive memory saves.
- If the tool schema does not expose `capture_prompt`, omit it rather than
  failing the save.
- `type` is advisory metadata; use `architecture` for planning artifacts,
  `decision` for choices, `bugfix` for corrections, or match the artifact kind.

## mem_get_observation Contract

`mem_search` returns 300-character previews. For full artifact content, always
follow up with `mem_get_observation(id)`. Never treat a search preview as
source material.

## mem_search Queries

To find an existing artifact:

```
mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}", project: "{project}")
```

To list all artifacts for a change:

```
mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/", project: "{project}")
```

## Project Isolation

Every `mem_save` and `mem_search` MUST include `project`. Observations are
scoped by project; omitting `project` breaks isolation and pollutes other
projects' recall.

## Concurrent Writes

Two concurrent saves of the same `(project, topic_key)` must not crash. The
upsert path handles this at the SQLite level (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`). Do not
implement manual read-modify-write cycles; always use `mem_save` with the
topic_key above.

## Memory Lifecycle

Saved memories can become stale as the codebase evolves. TonyMem uses a
three-state lifecycle to prevent outdated memories from being trusted as
current facts:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `active` | Current, verified memory (default on save). |
| `proven` | Solution verified through repeated Q&A. Ranks first in `mem_search`. |
| `needs_review` | Stale memory that must be re-verified before use. |

### mem_review Contract

Lifecycle transitions are managed exclusively through `mem_review`:

```
mem_review(action: "mark_stale", ids: [...])       // → needs_review
mem_review(action: "mark_reviewed", ids: [...])    // → active
mem_review(action: "mark_proven", ids: [...])      // → proven
mem_review(action: "list", project: "{project}")   // list needs_review (default)
mem_review(action: "list", project: "{project}", status: "proven")  // list by status
```

Rules:
- All transitions accept any source state (no guard on the previous status).
- `mem_search` results include `lifecycle_status` in every row. When a result
  shows `needs_review`, do NOT treat it as a confirmed fact — verify it
  against the current codebase/state before acting on it.
- `proven` memories rank first in `mem_search` (before `active` and
  `needs_review`), so verified solutions surface first.
- When saving updated knowledge for an evolving topic, reuse the same
  `topic_key` to upsert in place, then `mark_reviewed` if the prior state was
  `needs_review`.

### SDD Artifact Lifecycle

SDD artifacts (`proposal`, `spec`, `design`, `tasks`, etc.) default to
`active`. Mark a design decision as `proven` only after it has been validated
through a completed `sdd-verify` phase or repeated Q&A. If the codebase
diverges from a stored artifact (e.g. the spec no longer matches
implementation), `mark_stale` it and re-verify before reusing it.

## Fallback When tonymem Is Unavailable

If `mem_save` or `mem_search` returns `available: false` or fails, degrade to
`none` mode for that operation: return the artifact inline in your response and
do not block the phase. Report the degraded path in the Section D return
envelope's `risks` field.

## Phase-specific instructions

disable-model-invocation: true
user-invocable: false
license: MIT

---

> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are
> the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Delegate to the dedicated `sdd-init` sub-agent.

## Executor Override

If you ARE the `sdd-init` sub-agent, continue. Do NOT delegate.

## Purpose

Bootstrap SDD context: detect stack, configure persistence, cache testing capabilities.

## What You Receive

- Project root (from orchestrator context)
- Optional: user preferences if interactive

## Execution Steps

### 1. Detect Project Stack
Analyze project to detect:
- Language(s): Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.
- Framework(s): FastAPI, Next.js, Gin, Actix, etc.
- Test runner: pytest, jest, go test, cargo test, etc.
- Build/type-check commands
- Lint/formatter config

### 2. Detect Testing Capabilities
Determine:
- `strict_tdd` support (test runner exists, can run RED→GREEN cycles)
- Available test commands
- Coverage tool availability

### 3. Cache Capabilities
Persist `sdd-init/{project}` in tonymem:
```json
{
  "project": "{project}",
  "stack": ["python", "fastapi", "postgresql"],
  "test_runner": "pytest",
  "test_command": "pytest -xvs",
  "coverage_command": "pytest --cov",
  "build_command": "mypy . && pytest",
  "strict_tdd": true,
  "strict_tdd_module": "skills/sdd-apply/strict-tdd.md",
  "verify_module": "skills/sdd-verify/strict-tdd-verify.md"
}
```

### 3. Configure Artifact Store
Prompt user (Interactive) or detect (Auto):
- `tonymem` (default) — fast, no files
- `openspec` — file-based, shareable
- `hybrid` — both

Persist `sdd-init/{project}` with `artifact_store.mode`.

### 4. Configure Preflight Defaults
Cache user preferences:
- Execution mode: `interactive` (default) | `auto`
- Delivery strategy: `ask-on-risk` (default) | `auto-chain` | `single-pr` | `exception-ok`
- Review budget: `400` lines (default) | custom

### 5. Persist Init Context
Follow Section C from `sdd-phase-common.md`:
- artifact: `project-context`
- topic_key: `sdd-init/{project}`
- type: `config`

### 4. Return Summary
Return Section D envelope with detected stack, capabilities, and next_recommended: `sdd-new` or `sdd-onboard`.

## Rules
- Run ONLY once per project (check `mem_search` first)
- Cache is per-project; multi-project supported
- If project already initialized, return cached config
