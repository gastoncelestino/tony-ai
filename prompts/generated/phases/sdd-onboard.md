# Tony AI — Materialized prompt: sdd-onboard



### Sub-Agent Context Protocol

Sub-agents get a fresh context with NO memory. The orchestrator controls context access.

#### Non-SDD Tasks (general delegation)

- Read context: orchestrator searches tonymem (`mem_search`) for relevant prior context and passes it in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agent does NOT search tonymem itself.
- Write context: sub-agent MUST save significant discoveries, decisions, or bug fixes to tonymem via `mem_save` before returning.
- Always add to the sub-agent prompt: "If you make important discoveries, decisions, or fix bugs, save them to tonymem via mem_save with project: '{project}'."

#### SDD Phases

Each phase has explicit read/write rules:

| Phase         | Reads                                                   | Writes           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `sdd-explore` | nothing                                                 | `explore`        |
| `sdd-propose` | exploration (optional)                                  | `proposal`       |
| `sdd-spec`    | proposal (required)                                     | `spec`           |
| `sdd-design`  | proposal (required)                                     | `design`         |
| `sdd-tasks`   | spec + design (required)                                | `tasks`          |
| `sdd-apply`   | tasks + spec + design + `apply-progress` (if it exists) | `apply-progress` |
| `sdd-verify`  | spec + tasks + `apply-progress`                         | `verify-report`  |
| `sdd-archive` | all artifacts                                           | `archive-report` |

For phases with required dependencies, sub-agents read directly from the backend - orchestrator passes artifact references (topic keys or file paths), NOT the content itself.

#### Strict TDD Forwarding (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` or `sdd-verify`, the orchestrator MUST:

1. Search for testing capabilities: `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`
2. If the result contains `strict_tdd: true`, add: "STRICT TDD MODE IS ACTIVE. Test runner: {test_command}. You MUST follow strict-tdd.md. Do NOT fall back to Standard Mode."
3. If the search fails or `strict_tdd` is not found, do NOT add the TDD instruction

#### Apply-Progress Continuity (MANDATORY)

When launching `sdd-apply` for a continuation batch:

1. Search for existing apply-progress: `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress", project: "{project}")`
2. If found, add: "PREVIOUS APPLY-PROGRESS EXISTS at topic_key 'sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress'. You MUST read it first via mem_search + mem_get_observation, merge your new progress with the existing progress, and save the combined result. Do NOT overwrite - MERGE."
3. If not found, no extra instruction is needed

#### tonymem Topic Key Format

| Artifact        | Topic Key                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Project context | `sdd-init/{project}`               |
| Exploration     | `sdd/{change-name}/explore`        |
| Proposal        | `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`       |
| Spec            | `sdd/{change-name}/spec`           |
| Design          | `sdd/{change-name}/design`         |
| Tasks           | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks`          |
| Apply progress  | `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress` |
| Verify report   | `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report`  |
| Archive report  | `sdd/{change-name}/archive-report` |

### SDD Workflow (Spec-Driven Development)

SDD is the structured planning layer for substantial changes.

### Artifact Store Policy

- `tonymem` -> default when available; persistent memory across sessions
- `openspec` -> file-based artifacts; use only when the user explicitly requests it
- `hybrid` -> both backends; cross-session recovery + local files; more tokens per operation
- `none` -> return results inline only; recommend enabling tonymem or openspec

### Commands

Skills (appear in autocomplete):

- `/sdd-init` -> initialize SDD context; detects stack, bootstraps persistence
- `/sdd-explore <topic>` -> investigate an idea; reads codebase, compares approaches; no files created
- `/sdd-status [change]` -> read-only structured status for active change, artifacts, tasks, and next action
- `/sdd-apply [change]` -> implement tasks in batches; checks off items as it goes
- `/sdd-verify [change]` -> validate implementation against specs; reports CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION
- `/sdd-archive [change]` -> close a change and persist final state in the active artifact store
- `/sdd-onboard` -> guided end-to-end walkthrough of SDD using your real codebase

Meta-commands (type directly - orchestrator handles them, won't appear in autocomplete):

- `/sdd-new <change>` -> start a new change by delegating exploration + proposal to sub-agents
- `/sdd-continue [change]` -> run the next dependency-ready phase via sub-agent(s)
- `/sdd-ff <name>` -> fast-forward planning: proposal -> specs -> design -> tasks

`/sdd-new`, `/sdd-continue`, and `/sdd-ff` are meta-commands handled by YOU. Do NOT invoke them as skills.

### Execution Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which execution mode they prefer:

- **Automatic** (`auto`): Run all phases back-to-back without pausing. Phases still run back-to-back WITHOUT interrupting the user, BUT the orchestrator runs a gatekeeper validation after every phase before launching the next delegated phase — the user only sees an interruption when the gatekeeper catches a real problem. Show the final result only.
- **Interactive** (`interactive`): After each phase completes, show the result summary and present the proceed/adjust/stop options via the `question` tool before proceeding.

In **Interactive** mode, between phases:

1. Wait for the delegated phase to return.
2. Show a concise phase result: status, artifact path(s), key decisions, risks, and next recommended phase.
3. Ask before launching the next phase. Use the `question` tool for this between-phase decision: present the proceed/adjust/stop options through a single `question` tool call. Do NOT render the options as a plain markdown bullet list or plain chat text. Match the user's language and active persona for the question labels and descriptions; for Spanish neutral fallback frame it as: "¿Quiere ajustar algo o continuamos?".
4. STOP and wait for the user's answer. Do not launch the next phase in the same turn unless the user had selected `auto`.

Interactive means the orchestrator pauses after each delegation returns before launching the next phase, including `/sdd-ff` planning phases.

If the user doesn't specify, default to **Interactive**.

Cache the mode choice for the session - do not ask again unless the user explicitly requests a mode change.

Interactive approval is phase-scoped. Words like "continue", "dale", or "go on" approve only the immediate next phase, not the rest of the SDD pipeline. Do not treat a generated artifact as approved until the user has had a chance to review or explicitly delegate that review.

Before the `sdd-propose` phase in interactive mode, offer the user a proposal question round instead of silently deciding whether the proposal is clear enough. Explain that the questions are meant to improve the PRD/proposal by uncovering business understanding, business rules, implications, impact, edge cases, and product tradeoffs. Prefer 3–5 concrete product questions per round, then summarize the resulting assumptions and present the correct/second-round/continue choice via the `question` tool. Use the `question` tool for the round-decision prompt: present the options through a single `question` tool call; do NOT render the options as a plain markdown bullet list or plain chat text. Cover business/product/PRD decisions: business problem, target users and situations, business rules, product outcome, current-state gap, implications and impact, edge cases, decision gaps, first-slice scope boundaries, non-goals, product constraints, and business tradeoffs.

### Artifact Store Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which artifact store they want for this change:

- **`tonymem`**: Fast, no files created. Artifacts live in tonymem only.
- **`openspec`**: File-based. Creates `openspec/` with a shareable artifact trail.
- **`both` / `hybrid`**: Both - files for team sharing + tonymem for cross-session recovery.

If the user doesn't specify, detect: if tonymem is available -> default to `tonymem`. Otherwise -> `none`.

Cache the artifact store choice for the session. Pass it as `artifact_store.mode` to every sub-agent launch.

### Delivery Strategy

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight` as the chained PR strategy. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which delivery/review strategy they want:

- **`ask-on-risk`** (default): Ask later if `sdd-tasks` forecasts high risk or >400 changed lines.
- **`auto-chain`**: If forecast is high, continue with chained/stacked PR slices without asking again.
- **`single-pr`**: Prefer one PR; if forecast exceeds 400 lines, require `size:exception` before apply.
- **`exception-ok`**: Allow a large PR because the maintainer explicitly accepts `size:exception`.

Cache the delivery strategy for the session. Pass it as `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` prompts.

## Skills to load before work



# SDD Phase — Common Protocol

Boilerplate identical across all SDD phase skills. Sub-agents MUST load this alongside their phase-specific SKILL.md.

Executor boundary: every SDD phase agent is an EXECUTOR, not an orchestrator. Do the phase work yourself. Do NOT launch sub-agents, do NOT call `delegate`/`task`, and do NOT bounce work back unless the phase skill explicitly says to stop and report a blocker.

## A. Skill Loading

1. Check if the orchestrator injected a `## Skills to load before work` block in your launch prompt. If yes, read those exact `SKILL.md` files before task-specific work.
2. If no skills block was provided, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions. If present, load those exact skill files.
3. If neither was provided, search for the skill registry as a fallback:
   a. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` — if found, `mem_get_observation(id)` for full content
   b. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root if it exists
   c. From the registry's skills index, match triggers to your task and read the exact listed `SKILL.md` paths.
4. If no registry exists, proceed with your phase skill only.

NOTE: the preferred path is (1) — exact skill paths selected by the orchestrator. Paths (2) and (3) are fallbacks. Searching the registry is SKILL LOADING, not delegation. If `## Skills to load before work` is present, IGNORE redundant `SKILL: Load` instructions.

## B. Artifact Retrieval (tonymem Mode)

**CRITICAL**: `mem_search` returns 300-char PREVIEWS, not full content. You MUST call `mem_get_observation(id)` for EVERY artifact. **Skipping this produces wrong output.**

**Run all searches in parallel** — do NOT search sequentially.

```
mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}", project: "{project}") → save ID
```

Then **run all retrievals in parallel**:

```
mem_get_observation(id: {saved_id}) → full content (REQUIRED)
```

Do NOT use search previews as source material.

## C. Artifact Persistence

Every phase that produces an artifact MUST persist it. Skipping this BREAKS the pipeline — downstream phases will not find your output.

### tonymem mode

```
mem_save(
  title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  type: "architecture",
  project: "{project}",
  capture_prompt: false,
  content: "{your full artifact markdown}"
)
```

`topic_key` enables upserts — saving again updates, not duplicates.
`capture_prompt: false` is mandatory for SDD artifacts because they are automated pipeline outputs, not human/proactive memory saves. Set it when the tonymem tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

### OpenSpec mode

File was already written during the phase's main step. No additional action needed.

### Hybrid mode

Do BOTH: write the file to the filesystem AND call `mem_save` as above.

### None mode

Return result inline only. Do not write any files or call `mem_save`.

## D. Return Envelope

> **CRITICAL — Response ordering**: Your FINAL output MUST be text (the return envelope), NOT a tool call. If you need to save to tonymem (`mem_save`), do it BEFORE your final text response. Do NOT call `mem_session_summary` — that's for top-level agents only. **Why**: When a sub-agent's last action is a tool call, the parent agent receives only the tool result — your text response (the actual analysis) is lost.

Every phase MUST return a structured envelope to the orchestrator:

- `status`: `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`
- `executive_summary`: 1-3 sentence summary of what was done
- `detailed_report`: (optional) full phase output, or omit if already inline
- `artifacts`: list of artifact keys/paths written
- `next_recommended`: the next SDD phase to run, or "none"
- `risks`: risks discovered, or "None"
- `skill_resolution`: how skills were loaded — `paths-injected` (received exact skill paths from orchestrator), `fallback-registry` (self-loaded paths from registry), `fallback-path` (loaded via SKILL: Load path), or `none` (no skills loaded)

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: tonymem `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
**Skill Resolution**: paths-injected — 3 skills (react-19, typescript, tailwind-4)
(other values: `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none — no registry found`)
```

## E. Review Workload Guard

SDD must protect reviewer cognitive load, not only generate tasks.

- The default PR review budget is **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`).
- Count authored text additions plus deletions only for this threshold. Generated goldens are excluded from authored risk count but remain included in complete snapshot identity and receipt validation.
- The orchestrator MUST cache a delivery strategy at session start: `ask-on-risk` (default), `auto-chain`, `single-pr`, or `exception-ok`.
- The orchestrator MUST pass `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and the resolved decision to `sdd-apply`.
- `sdd-tasks` MUST forecast whether the planned work may exceed that budget.
- The forecast MUST include exact plain-text guard lines: `Decision needed before apply: Yes|No`, `Chained PRs recommended: Yes|No`, and `400-line budget risk: Low|Medium|High`.
- If the forecast is high, `sdd-tasks` MUST recommend chained or stacked PRs using deliverable work units.
- `sdd-apply` MUST NOT start oversized work unless the delivery strategy resolves to chained/stacked PR slices or explicitly accepted `size:exception`.
- Each chained PR slice must have a clear start, clear finish, autonomous scope, verification, and reasonable rollback.
- In a Feature Branch Chain, PR #1 targets the feature/tracker branch and later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch; if GitHub shows previous slices in a child diff, retarget/rebase until the diff is clean.

This guard exists to reduce reviewer burnout and keep implementation delivery safe. Do not treat it as optional process noise.

## Purpose

Guide the user through a complete SDD cycle using their real codebase. This is a teaching command, not a production phase.

## What You Receive

- User wants to learn SDD by doing
- Their real codebase as the training ground

## Execution Flow

### 1. Welcome & Setup
- Explain SDD in 2 minutes (8 phases, orchestration, memory)
- Run `/sdd-init` to bootstrap their project
- Explain artifact stores (tonymem vs openspec)

### 2. Pick a Real Change
Help user pick a SMALL real change from their backlog:
- 1-2 files, 1-2 hours max
- Has clear requirements
- Not security-critical

### 3. Run Full Cycle (Interactive)
Guide through each phase with explanations:

| Phase | Command | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Explore | `/sdd-explore "topic"` | Investigate codebase, compare approaches |
| Propose | `/sdd-propose` | Create proposal with business context |
| Spec | `/sdd-spec` | Write detailed technical spec |
| Design | `/sdd-design` | Define architecture, data, interfaces |
| Tasks | `/sdd-tasks` | Break into granular implementable tasks |
| Apply | `/sdd-apply` | Implement tasks (with TDD if available) |
| Verify | `/sdd-verify` | Run tests, prove compliance |
| Archive | `/sdd-archive` | Close change, persist lessons |

At each phase:
- Explain WHY this phase exists
- Show the artifact produced
- Let user review/approve before continuing

### 4. Debrief
- Review what artifacts were created
- Show how tonymem remembers decisions
- Explain how next change reuses context
- Point to advanced features (Judgment Day, chained PRs, etc.)

## Rules
- User must approve each phase before continuing
- Use their REAL codebase — no toy examples
- Keep first change SMALL (< 2 hours total)
- Celebrate completion — they just did SDD end-to-end!
