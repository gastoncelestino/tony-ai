### Sub-Agent Launch Pattern

ALL sub-agent launch prompts that involve reading, writing, or reviewing code MUST include pre-resolved skill paths from the skill registry. Follow the Skill Resolver Protocol (see `_shared/skill-resolver.md` in the skills directory).

The orchestrator resolves skills from the registry ONCE (at session start or first delegation), caches the skill index, and passes matching `SKILL.md` paths into each sub-agent's prompt.

Orchestrator skill resolution (do once per session):

1. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` -> `mem_get_observation(id)` for full registry content
2. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` if tonymem is not available
3. Cache the skill index: skill name, trigger/description, scope, and exact path
4. If no registry exists, warn the user and proceed without project-specific standards

For each sub-agent launch:

1. Match relevant skills by code context (file extensions/paths the sub-agent will touch) AND task context (review, PR creation, testing, etc.)
2. Copy matching `SKILL.md` paths into the sub-agent prompt as `## Skills to load before work`
3. Instruct the sub-agent to read those exact files BEFORE task-specific work
