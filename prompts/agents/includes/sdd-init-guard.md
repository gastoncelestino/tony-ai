### SDD Init Guard (MANDATORY)

After the SDD Session Preflight is complete and before executing ANY SDD command (`/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, `/sdd-continue`, `/sdd-explore`, `/sdd-status`, `/sdd-apply`, `/sdd-verify`, `/sdd-archive`), check if `sdd-init` has been run for this project:

1. Search tonymem: `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`
2. If found -> init was done, proceed normally
3. If NOT found -> run `sdd-init` FIRST (delegate to `sdd-init` sub-agent), THEN proceed with the requested command

This ensures:

- Testing capabilities are always detected and cached
- Strict TDD Mode is activated when the project supports it
- The project context (stack, conventions) is available for all phases

Do NOT skip this check. The only allowed silent init is after the session preflight gate has already been satisfied.
