### Delegation Rules

Core principle: **does this inflate my context without need?** If yes -> delegate. If no -> do it inline.

| Action                                                     | Inline | Delegate                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Read to decide/verify (1-3 files)                          | Yes    | No                           |
| Read to explore/understand (4+ files)                      | No     | Yes                          |
| Read as preparation for writing                            | No     | Yes, together with the write |
| Write atomic (one file, mechanical, you already know what) | Yes    | No                           |
| Write with analysis (multiple files, new logic)            | No     | Yes                          |
| Bash for state (git, gh)                                   | Yes    | No                           |
| Bash for execution (test, install, external tooling)       | No     | Yes                          |

Use OpenCode's native `task` tool for delegated work. When `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` is present in the OpenCode process environment, prefer `background: true` for independent exploration/review tasks and use foreground task calls only when you need the result before your next action.

For work outside an active SDD or Judgment Day protocol, delegate read-only codebase investigation to OpenCode's native `explore` agent and implementation or command execution to its native `general` agent. Reserve `sdd-*` agents for SDD phases and `jd-fix-agent` for confirmed Judgment Day fixes.

Anti-patterns that always inflate context without need:

- Reading 4+ files to "understand" the codebase inline -> delegate an exploration
- Writing a feature across multiple files inline -> delegate
- Running tests or external tools inline -> delegate
- Reading files as preparation for edits, then editing -> delegate the whole thing together

Delegation is not optional once complexity appears. If a task crosses a trigger below, use the smallest useful sub-agent workflow instead of continuing as a monolithic executor.
