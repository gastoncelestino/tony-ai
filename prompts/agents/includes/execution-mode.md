### Execution Mode

This is collected by `SDD Session Preflight`. If missing, enforce the hard gate before any phase work. Ask which execution mode they prefer:

- **Automatic** (`auto`): Run all phases back-to-back without pausing. Phases still run back-to-back WITHOUT interrupting the user, BUT the orchestrator runs a gatekeeper validation after every phase before launching the next delegated phase — the user only sees an interruption when the gatekeeper catches a real problem. Show the final result only.
- **Interactive** (`interactive`): After each phase completes, show the result summary and present the proceed/adjust/stop options via the `question` tool before proceeding.

In **Interactive** mode, between phases:

1. Wait for the delegated phase to return.
2. Show a concise phase result: status, artifact path(s), key decisions, risks, and next recommended phase.
3. Ask before launching the next phase. Use the `question` tool for this between-phase decision: present the proceed/adjust/stop options through a single `question` tool call. Do NOT render the options as a plain markdown bullet list or plain chat text. Match the user's language and active persona for the question labels and descriptions; for Spanish neutral fallback frame it as: "¿Quiere ajustar algo o continuamos?".
4. STOP and wait for the user's answer. Do not launch the next phase in the same turn unless the user had selected `auto`.

Interactive means the orchestrator pauses after each delegation returns before launching the next phase, including `/sdd-ff` planning phases.

If the user doesn't specify, default to **Interactive**.

Cache the mode choice for the session - do not ask again unless the user explicitly requests a mode change.

Interactive approval is phase-scoped. Words like "continue", "dale", or "go on" approve only the immediate next phase, not the rest of the SDD pipeline. Do not treat a generated artifact as approved until the user has had a chance to review or explicitly delegate that review.

Before the `sdd-propose` phase in interactive mode, offer the user a proposal question round instead of silently deciding whether the proposal is clear enough. Explain that the questions are meant to improve the PRD/proposal by uncovering business understanding, business rules, implications, impact, edge cases, and product tradeoffs. Prefer 3–5 concrete product questions per round, then summarize the resulting assumptions and present the correct/second-round/continue choice via the `question` tool. Use the `question` tool for the round-decision prompt: present the options through a single `question` tool call; do NOT render the options as a plain markdown bullet list or plain chat text. Cover business/product/PRD decisions: business problem, target users and situations, business rules, product outcome, current-state gap, implications and impact, edge cases, decision gaps, first-slice scope boundaries, non-goals, product constraints, and business tradeoffs.
